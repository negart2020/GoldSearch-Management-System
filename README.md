# Gold Search Simulator: AI Pathfinding Visualization 🏆

An interactive web-based simulator developed with **ASP.NET Core Razor Pages** to visualize and compare classical AI search algorithms in a 2D grid environment.

### 📅 Project Timeline & Context
- **Developed**: Summer 2025 (Mordad & Shahrivar 1404)
- **Status**: Completed and submitted as a final project.
- **Course**: Artificial Intelligence / Computer Vision
- **Supervised by**: Dr. Basiri
- **Institution**: University of Shahrekord
- **Developer**: Negar Tahvili

### 🧠 Implemented Search Strategies
This project provides a comparative analysis of four fundamental algorithms as detailed in the technical report:
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: Guaranteed shortest path in unweighted grids.
- **UCS (Uniform Cost Search)**: Optimal search considering movement costs.
- **A* (A-Star)**: Efficient heuristic-based search using Manhattan distance.
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: Explores depth first; demonstrated as a non-optimal pathfinding method in the report.

### 📊 Key Insights from the Technical Report
According to the project documentation, the performance of these algorithms was tested under various scenarios:
1. **Optimality**: BFS, UCS, and A* consistently found the shortest path.
2. **Path Length**: DFS often resulted in significantly longer paths compared to the other three.
3. **Efficiency**: A* showed the most efficient node exploration due to its heuristic nature.

### 🛠 Technology Stack
- **Backend**: C# / .NET Core (Razor Pages)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Logic**: Custom implementation of Search Algorithms
