# Gold Search Simulator: AI Pathfinding Visualization 🏆

An interactive web-based simulator developed with **ASP.NET Core Razor Pages** to visualize and compare classical AI search algorithms in a 2D grid environment.

### 🎓 Project Overview
- **Course**: Computer Vision / Artificial Intelligence
- **Supervised by**: Dr. Basiri
- **Developer**: Negar Tahvili
- **Institution**: University of Shahrekord

### 🧠 Implemented Search Strategies
This project provides a comparative analysis of four fundamental algorithms:
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: Guaranteed shortest path in unweighted grids.
- **UCS (Uniform Cost Search)**: Optimal search considering movement costs.
- **A* (A-Star)**: Heuristic-based search (Manhattan distance) for efficiency.
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: Explores depth first; used to demonstrate non-optimal pathfinding.

### 🛠 Technology Stack
- **Backend**: C# / .NET Core
- **Frontend**: Razor Pages, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Styling**: Bootstrap (Responsive Design)

### 📊 Key Insights from Report
- Comparison of path length and node exploration between optimal (A*, BFS, UCS) and non-optimal (DFS) methods.
- Integration of custom Grid/Cell models to manage obstacles and target coordinates.
